/**
 * This package contains the classes that are used to implement the APS
 * (Advanced Planning and Scheduling) project. The APS project is a project that
 * aims to optimize the scheduling of tasks in a production environment. The
 * project is implemented in Java and uses JavaFX for the GUI. The project
 * consists of several classes that implement the different components of the
 * APS system, such as the scheduler, the schedule, and the Gantt chart.
 * <p>
 * This is a personal project that I implemented during my internship at <a
 * href="https://www.linkedata.com.cn/">Linkedata</a>. The project is just a
 * prototype and is not intended for production use.
 * </p>
 *
 * @note We are only consider a order finished on a single machine which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrelated-machines_scheduling"> unrelated machine scheduling problem</a> , not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job-shop_scheduling" > job-shop schduling problem</a>
